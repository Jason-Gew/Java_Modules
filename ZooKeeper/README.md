*  Distributed System Dynamic Node Manager (server mode & client mode) based on Apache ZooKeeper.

*  Server mode (NodeManager) provides node registration alone with information, supports continuous watching
   coordinating with other nodes.

*  Client mode (NodeClient) provides sync method and async mechanism to get node(s) info.

*  Advanced Watcher support single/event output to the message queue for external process.

* This project is under Continuous Integration process.
